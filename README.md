Dude, just finished watching Lilo & Stitch again, it's wild how much this movie hits different now. I mean, like, alien experiments and Hawaiian vibes, what even, right? üòÇ I completely forgot how chaotic Stitch is, like his whole destruction energy is seriously goals sometimes, lol. Also, Nani and her struggle to keep stuff together, ugh, hits way too close to home these days. It's like, girl, same.

But you know what's crazy? How the freaking movie makes you wanna just adopt all the creatures. Like, I was half-watching, half-thinking if I could download the movie again without feeling guilty, but c'mon, the heart wants what it wants. Seriously, how does it weave the chaos and the whole found family vibe so well? My emotions are like all over the place now. Ugh, Disney and their emotionally manipulative magic tricks, I'm not okay.

> Cos dude, remember when we tried to watch the movie at that midnight hangout ages ago and got distracted halfway with snacks and memes? LMAO, classic us. Anyway, I still think Lilo giving everything to save her little blue menace is the realest. We all need a Lilo in our life, tbh, who sticks around when things get messy and then you both learn to be ohana or something deep like that. It's weirdly comforting in a way when life's just gestures wildly.

Oh and those space scenes? Insane detail, like when did that happen? Kudos to them, cuz aliens have legit screen time, and I'm here for it. But, you know, I'm probably babbling now, late-night movie feels got me good. Shouldn't have started it on a whim, sigh. Or maybe it's exactly what I needed, idk. Whatever, I'll make sense of this tomorrow.

console.log(I need more coffee);

Alright, that's the gist, kinda needed to brain-vomit this out somewhere, thanks for the space, man. Hit me up if you ever wanna trip into nostalgia again, maybe something lighter next time? Or not, hahaha. Peace ‚úåÔ∏è
